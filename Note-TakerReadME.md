  ## Description:  
  I made this project in order to write and save notes for any purpose in one's life. The technologies I used to create this are node and express in javascript.

    
  ## Installation: 
  Needs to run node in the terminal, so node needs to be installed.
  
  ## Usage: 
  After installation of node, the user will see a notes landing page. After clicking on the link, the user sees a page with existing notes from history, a save icon and a + icon so the user can save and add new notes for themselves.  The notes from the past will be on the left side of the page and then the new notes will be on the right side of the page.
